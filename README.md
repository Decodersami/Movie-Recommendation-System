# Building a Movie Recommendation System with NLP and K-Means Clustering

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project repository!

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on developing a movie recommendation system using the advanced technique of K-Means Clustering. By analyzing user preferences and movie data, the system predicts which movies a user might enjoy, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Features:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Utilizing the K-Means clustering algorithm to group movies into clusters based on similarity.
- **NLP Techniques**: Implementing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie descriptions or reviews for clustering.
- **Model Optimization**: Utilizing techniques like the Elbow Method for model evaluation and optimization to enhance the accuracy of the recommendation system.
- **Full Code and Video Explainers**: The repository includes full code implementations and video explainers to guide you through the development process.

## Project Structure:

- **`movie_recommendation.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for building the movie recommendation system.
- **`data/`**: Directory containing movie datasets and any other necessary data files.
- **`README.md`**: Detailed documentation about the project, including setup instructions and usage guidelines.
- **`images/`**: Directory containing images or screenshots related to the project.
- **`videos/`**: Directory containing video explainers for the project.

## Getting Started:

To get started with the Movie Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install any required dependencies listed in the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Open and run the `movie_recommendation.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to build and evaluate the recommendation system.
5. Refer to the provided video explainers for additional guidance and insights.

## Usage:

- Follow the step-by-step instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to load the movie datasets, preprocess the data, and implement the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics and visualization techniques.
- Experiment with different parameters and techniques to optimize the model for better recommendations.
